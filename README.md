# Development Environment - Setup Scripts

Collection of scripts for fast setup/deployment of application environments.

Examples:
- Installation of common packages for a specific programming language.
- Installation and configuration of a database.



WARNING:
Most of these scripts MUST NOT be used for deployment in production environments, but for dev, stage and/or test. They were probably created WITHOUT concerns to security, performance, scalability, etc.
