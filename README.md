# Development Environment Setup

Collection os scripts to fast deploy development environments.

Examples:
- Installation of commom packages for a specific programming language
- Installation and configuration of a dev/testing database.


Note: These scripts should not be used for deploying production environment. Most of them do not have configurations related to security, tunning and other concerns related to a production environment.
If you decide to use them in your production environment, do it at your own risk.
